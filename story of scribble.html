	<p>A doodle is a drawing made while a person's attention is otherwise occupied. Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be composed of random and abstract lines, generally without ever lifting the drawing device from the paper, in which case it is usually called a scribble.</p>
	<p>Popular kinds of doodles include cartoon versions of teachers or companions in a school, famous TV or comic characters, invented fictional beings, landscapes, geometric shapes, patterns, textures, or phallic scenes. Most people who doodle often remake the same shape or type of doodle throughout their lifetime.</p>
	<p>Doodling has positive effects on human comprehension as well. Creating visual depictions of information allows for a deeper understanding of material being learned.[10] When doodling, a person is engaging neurological pathways in ways that allow for effective and efficient sifting and processing of information.[4] For these reasons, doodling is used as an effective study tool and memory device.</p>
	<p>Doodling can be used as a stress relieving technique. This is similar to other motor activities such as fidgeting or pacing that are also used to alleviate mental stress. According to a review of over 9,000 submitted doodles, nearly 2/3 of respondents recalled doodling when in a "tense or restless state" as a means to reduce those feelings.[11] Scientists believe that doodling's stress relieving properties arise from the way that the act of doodling engages with the brain's default mode network.[2] According to graphologist and behavior specialist Ingrid Seger-Woznicki, "we [doodle] because weâ€™re problem solving on an unconscious level" and seeking to "create our life without stressing about it".[12] Doodling is often incorporated into art therapy, allowing its users to slow down, focus and de-stress.</p>

		<li>MY EXPERIENCE</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It all started in the pandemic,even when i had some interst in drawing and craft works due to everyday scedule i couldn't give more preference to it but at the time of pandemic i had a lot of time to explore myself and time to improve myself in various feilds.Doodling intially started as some timepass but as i kept doing it the intrest got amplified.This not only a intrest but i also found it was a relaxing work to do it also helped me find a new side in me i felt it really good,it helped me stay calm and understand little thins in a better way.</p>
